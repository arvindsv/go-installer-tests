Expected directory structure for testing of a new installer. Each installer type or platform under test should have this
directory structure:

.
|-- data
`-- scripts
    `-- provision
    |-- install_agent
    |-- install_server
    |-- run_on_agent
    |-- run_on_server
    |-- upgrade_agent
    |-- upgrade_server
    |-- destroy


Details:

1. data/
   =====

   Can have any files in it, which are needed by scripts. This directory will need to be shared with the virtual machines or containers,
   during provisioning (see below).




2. scripts/
   ========

   Can have any scripts needed during testing. Will need to have scripts mentioned below, at least. All the scripts below should fail
   with a non-zero exit code, if something goes wrong.




3. scripts/provision
   =================

   This script will be run at the beginning of a test run. It is expected to setup the virtual machines or containers needed to run an
   agent and a server. It does not need to install an agent or server. Usually, it makes sure that Java is installed.


   Context provided to this script:
   --------------------------------

   Command line arguments:
     1) Port: An unused port on the host, to which port 8153 on the Go Server container should be forwarded.


   Expectations from this script:
   --------------------------------

     1) Will setup VMs or containers needed by the scripts below (could be both server and agent VM or just one).

     2) Will make sure that the hostname "go-server" resolves to the Go Server VM, from the Go Agent VM.

     3) Will ensure that the prerequisites for the agent and server installation are met (Example: Java 7).

     4) Will fail with non-zero exit code if not able to, or something goes wrong.




4. scripts/install_agent
   =====================

   This script will be run some time after provisioning and will need to install the specified Go Agent.

   Context provided to this script:
   --------------------------------

   Command line arguments:
     1) Filename: This is a filename of an agent installer file which will be in the "data/" directory. Example: go-agent-15.1.0.1863-solaris.gz

        It will be ensured that this file will be in the data/ directory. But, the path to the data/ directory will not be part of the argument.
        It will just have the filename.


   Expectations from this script:
   --------------------------------

     1) Will run the Go Agent installer for the specified agent, in the earlier mentioned provisioned Go Agent VM or container.

     2) Will point the Go Agent to the Go Server (using the hostname "go-server") and will start it.

     3) Will fail with non-zero exit code if not able to, or something goes wrong.




5. scripts/install_server
   ======================

   This script will be run some time after provisioning and will need to install the specified Go Server.

   Context provided to this script:
   --------------------------------

   Command line arguments:
     1) Filename: This is a filename of a server installer file which will be in the "data/" directory. Example: go-server-15.1.0.1863-solaris.gz

        It will be ensured that this file will be in the data/ directory. But, the path to the data/ directory will not be part of the argument.
        It will just have the filename.


   Expectations from this script:
   --------------------------------

     1) Will run the Go Server installer for the specified server, in the earlier mentioned provisioned Go Server VM or container.

     2) Need not wait for the Go Server to finish starting.

     3) Will fail with non-zero exit code if not able to, or something goes wrong.




6. scripts/run_on_agent
   ====================

   This script will be run some time after provisioning and will need to be able to run a command on the agent VM or container.

   Context provided to this script:
   --------------------------------

   Command line arguments: A command, with arguments will be provided to this, as command-line arguments.


   Expectations from this script:
   --------------------------------

     1) Will run the command specified, in the earlier mentioned provisioned Go Agent VM or container.

     2) Will exit with the same code as the command, if the command runs.

     3) Will fail with non-zero exit code if not able to, or something goes wrong.




7. scripts/run_on_server
   =====================

   This script will be run some time after provisioning and will need to be able to run a command on the server VM or container.

   Context provided to this script:
   --------------------------------

   Command line arguments: A command, with arguments will be provided to this, as command-line arguments.


   Expectations from this script:
   --------------------------------

     1) Will run the command specified, in the earlier mentioned provisioned Go Server VM or container.

     2) Will exit with the same code as the command, if the command runs.

     3) Will fail with non-zero exit code if not able to, or something goes wrong.




8. scripts/upgrade_agent
   =====================

   This script will be run some time after provisioning and will need to upgrade an existing Go Agent, using the specified installation file.

   Context provided to this script:
   --------------------------------

   Command line arguments:
     1) Filename: This is a filename of the new agent installer file which will be in the "data/" directory. Example: go-agent-15.1.0.1863-solaris.gz

        It will be ensured that this file will be in the data/ directory. But, the path to the data/ directory will not be part of the argument.
        It will just have the filename.


   Expectations from this script:
   --------------------------------

     1) Will upgrade the Go Agent using the specified installer, in the earlier mentioned provisioned Go Agent VM or container.

     2) Will fail with non-zero exit code if not able to, or something goes wrong.




9. scripts/upgrade_server
